MindHive is a **community neuroscience** platform for:

1. students & teachers who seek authentic research experiences,
2. scientists (in neuroscience, cognitive science and/or psychology) who seek to address their research questions outside of the lab,
3. community-based organizations who seek to carry out grassroots research for policy change, and
4. members of the community who wish to contribute data by participating in our studies.

The goal of our platform is to contribute a healthy science ecosystem, engaging users in the full range of scientific inquiry, that is, the making of science.

Scientists, students, educators, not-for-profit organizations, and community members across the globe are invited to contribute studies, resources, and research data to the platform, as such supporting both science learning and scientific discovery.

## Student-teacher-scientist partnerships

MindHive supports virtual **student-teacher-scientist-community partnerships** using an open science approach. Our curriculum engages students in the full range of scientific inquiry, that is, the making of science. It is designed to support students’ critical thinking skills around scientific processes and concepts, encouraging students to gain an understanding of the dynamic nature of science as a process that involves developing theories, testing them empirically (through observation and experimentation), and revising these theories based on available data. By involving young citizen scientists in each other’s projects through peer-review and data collection, they will learn that scientific progress is a collaborative, iterative, and transparent process.
